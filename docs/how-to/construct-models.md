In this page we will learn how to construct neuron and network models in `xolotl` from scratch. The first step to constructing any model in `xolotl` is to create a container for everything we create in it. In this section (and anywhere else), we will use the variable `x` to hold the `xolotl` object.

```matlab
% create a xolotl object
x = xolotl;
```
`xolotl` is a *component-oriented* simulation environment, which means that all "things" that can exist in the model are pre-defined components; and models are created by linking this components together like building blocks.

`xolotl` has 4 fundamental types of components:

1. `compartment` Objects of this type are used to represent compartments. Compartments can model entire neurons or parts of neurons. Compartments contain all other component types.
2. `conductance` Objects of this type represent populations of ion channels. They are contained within compartments.
3. `synapse` Objects of this type represent populations of synapses. They connect two different compartments together.
4. `mechanism` Objects of this type can represent any arbitrary (typically intracellular) mechanism. For example, Calcium buffering is represented as a mechanism.

<!-- # How to create compartments -->

The first thing we want to do is create a compartment. A compartment is a piece of neural tissue that shares a common voltage. A compartment can represent a whole neuron, or a small part of one.

To create a compartment, we use:

```matlab
x.add('compartment','exampleNeuron','A',.01)
```

What we're doing here is creating a compartment and adding it to our `xolotl` object. This neuron is called `exampleNeuron`, and we are specifying that it has a surface area of 0.1 mm^2.

We get a prompt that looks like this:

```matlab
xolotl object with
---------------------
+ exampleNeuron  
---------------------
```

This tells us that our xolotl object has one compartment, and its name is `exampleNeuron`.

To inspect your `xolotl` object at any time, simply type its name. Here, since we used a variable called `x`, we type

```matlab
x
```

### Compartments
Compartments represent three-dimensional sections of membrane. A neuron can consist of one or more compartments. In multi-compartment neurons, axial synapses with very fast kinetics connect compartments. Compartments in different neurons can be connected with chemical or electrical synapses.

You can create a compartment (independent of a `xolotl` object) using [cpplab](https://github.com/sg-s/cpplab).

```matlab
% create a compartment with a specified volume
AB = cpplab('compartment', 'vol', 0.01)
```
`AB` is a free-floating object. You can inspect it like you would any other `MATLAB` object.

```matlab
>>  AB

AB =

compartment object with:

     hash : 44c3772
       Cm : 10
        A : 0.01
   radius : NaN
      vol : NaN
  Ca_average : NaN
  shell_thickness : NaN
  tree_idx : NaN
        V : -60
  neuron_idx : NaN
  Ca_target : NaN
       Ca : NaN
   Ca_out : 3000
      len : NaN
```

You can add it to your `xolotl` object.

```matlab
% add compartment AB to the xolotl object tree
x.add('AB', AB)
```

A handy shortcut for this is

```matlab
% add a compartment named AB with a specified volume
x.add('compartment', 'AB', 'vol', 0.01)
```

We will use this shortcut extensively in the documentation, but remember that you can always do things the "long" way.

There are many useful properties of each `compartment` object:
* The `hash` is an alphanumeric MD5 hash unique to the structure of this compartment.
* The specific membrane capacitance is `Cm` in $\mathrm{nF/mm^2}$.
* The membrane potential is `V` in $\mathrm{mV}$.

#### Size and shape of compartments
Compartments are assumed to be specified by their size or shape. In the case of size, compartments have a defined surface area `A` ($\mathrm{mm^2}$). If shape is instead defined, the compartment is assumed to be cylindrical with a `radius` and `len` (length). The surface area is then computed to be $2 \pi (r ^2 + rh)$ in single-compartment cases (and potentially lacking the cylindrical surface areas in the case of multi-compartment models). If the radius and length are defined (which they must be in multi-compartment cases), then the `A` property is ignored. Similarly, the compartment volume is contained within the `vol` property. In the case of a cylindrical compartment with defined radius and length, the volume is defined to be $\pi r^2 h$.

#### Calcium properties
* `Ca` contains the intracellular calcium concentration in $\mu$M.
* `Ca_out` contains the extracellular calcium concentration in $\mu$M.
* Calcium is buffered very rapidly upon passing through the cell membrane. Many models compute intracellular calcium concentration with respect to the volume of an interior "shell." This value is stored in `shell_thickness` in mm.
* In homeostatic tuning models, it is sometimes important to keep track of an average intracellular calcium concentration, `Ca_average` in $\mu$M.
* In homeostatic tuning models, it is sometimes important to keep track of a target intracellular calcium concentration, `Ca_target` in $\mu$M.

### Conductances
A conductance object can be created using [cpplab](https://github.com/sg-s/cpplab).

```matlab
% instantiate the fast sodium conductance from Prinz et al. 2003
>> NaV = cpplab('prinz/NaV', 'gbar', 1000, 'E', 50)
NaV =

 NaV object with:

          hash : a85ae87
          gbar : 1000
             E : 50
             m : NaN
             h : NaN
```
There are a few useful properties in each `conductance` object:
* The MD5 `hash` of this object.
* `gbar` contains the specific maximal conductance in $\mathrm{\mu S / mm^2}$.
* `E` contains the reversal potential in $\mathrm{mV}$.
* `m` contains the activation gating variable (unitless).
* `h` contains the (de)inactivation gating variable (unitless).

#### What conductances are available?
 All `C++` header files which define the conductances used in `xolotl` are contained in the `c++/conductances` folder in the `xolotl` directory. If you are unsure where this is, type this into your `MATLAB` prompt:

```matlab
fileparts(fileparts(which('xolotl')))
```

You can also list all conductances with

```matlab
cpplab.search('conductances')
```

### Synapses
Synapses connect compartments together. All synapses are `cpplab` objects.
In the xolotl tree, they should belong to the post-synaptic compartment.

Synapse objects contain the following properties:

* The MD5 `hash` of this object.
* `gmax` contains the maximal conductance in $\mathrm{\mu S}$.
* `s` contains the synaptic gating variable (unitless).

!!! Note "Why gmax?"
  Synapse maximal conductances are measured in nS whereas conductance maximal conductances
  are in $\mu S/mm^2$. The "bar" in $\bar{g}$ refers to the "specific" nature.
  In addition, this difference helps while searching for conductances and synapses,
  since you can find all maximal conductances of conductance objects with `'*gbar'`
  and all maximal conductances of synapse objects with `'*gmax'`.

Synapses are created between two compartments using the `connect` function. The first
argument is the name of the pre-synaptic compartment the second is the name of the
post-synaptic compartment. The function defaults to an electrical synapse and a
maximal conductance of 0 if not otherwise specified.

```matlab
% connect compartments AB and PD with an electrical synapse
x.connect('AB', 'PD')
% connect two compartments with an electrical synapse
% and specify properties
x.connect('AB', 'PD', 'gmax', 100)
% connect two compartments with a glutamatergic synapse
% kinetics from Prinz et al. 2004
x.connect('AB', 'LP', 'prinz/Glut')
% connect two compartments with a glutamatergic synapse
% and specify properties
x.connect('AB', 'LP', 'prinz/Glut', 'gmax', 100)
```

#### What synapses are available?

All `C++` header files which define the synapses used in `xolotl` are contained in the `c++/synapses` folder in the `xolotl` directory. If you are unsure where this is, type this into your `MATLAB` prompt:

```matlab
fileparts(fileparts(which('xolotl')))
```

You can also list all synapses with

```matlab
cpplab.search('synapses')
```


### Mechanisms


## The `add` function and the object tree
The general-purpose `add` function adds [cpplab](https://github.com/sg-s/cpplab) objects to the `xolotl` tree. In brief, a `cpplab` object is a special type of `MATLAB` data structure that secretly  binds `MATLAB` code to `C++` code. The advantage of this is that the user gets to work entirely in `MATLAB` but simulations run with the full power and speed of `C++`.

`xolotl` itself is a framework for creating and integrating neuronal and network models using `cpplab`.

### What can be added to what?
`compartments` are added directly to the `xolotl` object. `conductances` are added to `compartments`. `synapses` connect two compartments together but themselves are properties of the `xolotl` object. `mechanisms` are special types of `cpplab` objects that affect how `xolotl` performs computations. They include stochastic noise, calcium integration, homeostatic tuning, and so on. As such, they can be added to `compartments` or `conductances`.

### Exploring constructed models in the command line
`xolotl` objects are *bona fide* `MATLAB` objects and can be readily manipulated in the command line.
Here is an example of a `xolotl` object, representing the structure of a stomatogastric ganglion model from crustacea published in Prinz *et al.* 2004. The code to produce this model can be found in `examples/demo_stg.m`.

```matlab
>> x

xolotl object with
---------------------
+ AB  
  > ACurrent (g=500, E=-80)
  > CaS (g=60, E=26.173778091544)
  > CaT (g=25, E=26.173778091544)
  > HCurrent (g=0.1, E=-20)
  > KCa (g=50, E=-80)
  > Kd (g=1000, E=-80)
  > NaV (g=1000, E=50)
---------------------
+ LP  
  > ACurrent (g=200, E=-80)

  > HCurrent (g=0.5, E=-20)
  > KCa (g=0, E=-80)
  > Kd (g=250, E=-80)
  > Leak (g=0.3, E=-50)
  > NaV (g=1000, E=50)
---------------------
+ PY  
  > ACurrent (g=500, E=-80)
  > CaS (g=20, E=62.3932795257928)
  > CaT (g=24, E=62.3932795257928)
  > HCurrent (g=0.5, E=-20)
  > KCa (g=0, E=-80)
  > Kd (g=1250, E=-80)
  > Leak (g=0.1, E=-50)
  > NaV (g=1000, E=50)
---------------------
```
Displaying the `xolotl` object shows select properties of each conductance within each compartment. We can see that there are three compartments each with 7-8 conductances with varied maximal conductances. In addition, we can infer that the sodium channels have reversal potentials of $50~\mathrm{mV}$ and the potassium channels of $-80~\mathrm{mV}$.

In `MATLAB`, all compartments and conductances in this view are hyperlinked and can be clicked on to view that particular object. We can also access this view through the command line. Let's look at the first compartment.

```matlab
>> x.AB

ans =

 compartment object with:

             hash : bba3847
               Cm : 10
                A : 0.0628
  shell_thickness : NaN
         tree_idx : NaN
              vol : NaN
                V : -48.7425773412141
        Ca_target : NaN
       Ca_average : 97.5752632857105
       neuron_idx : NaN
              len : NaN
           radius : NaN
               Ca : 354.000031181001
           Ca_out : 3000
              NaV : NaV object
         HCurrent : HCurrent object
     CalciumMech1 : CalciumMech1 object
              CaS : CaS object
              KCa : KCa object
         ACurrent : ACurrent object
               Kd : Kd object
              CaT : CaT object
```

We see all the properties of a standard `compartment` object plus each of the `conductance`s added to the `xolotl` tree (using the `add` function). We can look closer at a conductance.

```matlab
>> x.AB.NaV

ans =

 NaV object with:

          hash : a85ae87
          gbar : 1000
             m : 0.0107532302761698
             h : 0.64304369213413
             E : 50
```

Since these are `MATLAB` objects, we can edit the properties *in-situ*.

```matlab
% set AB's NaV maximal conductance to zero
>> x.AB.NaV.gbar = 0

  > HCurrent (g=0.1, E=-20)
  > KCa (g=50, E=-80)

---------------------
```

## Hashing a model
Each `xolotl` object is hashed by the MD5 algorithm to determine a unit alphanumeric identifier. Two `xolotl` objects are different only if their underlying structure (compartments, types of conductances, synapses) are different -- not if parameters are different.

```matlab
% hash a xolotl object
>> x

xolotl object with
---------------------
+ AB  
  > ACurrent (g=5, E=-80)
  > CaS (g=0.113, E=30)
  > CaT (g=0.191, E=30)
  > HCurrent (g=0.128, E=-20)
  > KCa (g=0.163, E=-80)
  > Kd (g=0.11, E=-80)
  > Leak (g=0.099, E=-50)
  > NaV (g=0.181, E=30)
---------------------
>> x.hash

ans =

    '6b3a55344dbd63074cfd703061f9ae4d'
>> % the hash doesn't change when you change the parameters

>> x.AB.ACurrent.gbar = 0;

>> x.hash

ans =  
    '6b3a55344dbd63074cfd703061f9ae4d'
